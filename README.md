Pomodoro is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called 'Pomodoros' (from the Italian word for 'tomatoes') separated by breaks. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

Tomatoid is a pomodoro timer for KDE and is written in QML + Javascript
